Convolution Operations, CNN Feature Extraction, and Data Preprocessing

This project demonstrates foundational concepts in deep learning through convolution operations, feature extraction, and data preprocessing. Using TensorFlow, a 5×5 input matrix and a 3×3 kernel were applied with varying stride and padding settings to visualize 2D convolution outputs. For feature extraction, Sobel-X and Sobel-Y filters were used on a grayscale image to detect edges, while max and average pooling were implemented on a 4×4 matrix to illustrate spatial dimension reduction. Additionally, the Iris dataset was preprocessed using both Min-Max normalization and Z-score standardization, with logistic regression models trained on original and scaled datasets to compare accuracy and highlight the impact of preprocessing.
